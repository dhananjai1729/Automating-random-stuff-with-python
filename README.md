# Sleep Monitor

This repository contains a Python script for sleep monitoring. The script is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook (`sleepmonitor.ipynb`).

## Features

- Audio recording using the microphone.
- Sound event detection based on background noise calibration.
- Automatic saving of recordings in WAV format.
- Generation of spectrograms and text-based analysis for each recording segment.
- Recordings and analyses are stored in the `sleep_recordings` directory, organized by date.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- sounddevice: For audio recording.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- scipy: For signal processing (spectrogram generation).
- matplotlib: For plotting spectrograms.
- ipywidgets: For creating interactive UI elements in the Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install sounddevice numpy scipy matplotlib ipywidgets notebook
    ```
2.  **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Open `sleepmonitor.ipynb`.
4.  Select the desired input microphone from the dropdown menu.
5.  Click "Start Recording" to begin monitoring. The script will calibrate for background noise.
6.  Click "Stop Recording" to end the session.
7.  Recorded audio files (WAV), spectrogram images (PNG), and analysis text files (TXT) will be saved in the `sleep_recordings` directory.

Here I try to build applications rather than downloading applications.

Started with a sleep monitoring program
Seems like I have to sort out my snoring.

Confirmed this works on windows laptops as well.
